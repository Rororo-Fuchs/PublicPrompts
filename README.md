# PublicPrompts
Public GPT Prompts is a small collection of my prompts for GPT4.

ExpertArticleWriter_reduced is a prompt that helps You write texts. It summons several experts on a given topic, splits the topics into bits and suggests a structure for Your text. It then makes suggestions for each Sub-Topic which You can change as You like. At the end it outputs the whole text and lets You download it in a filetype You specify. I found it really helpfull for writing articles, applications for public funds and a plethora of other texts. The initial idea is based on Quicksilvers ExpertGPT-prompt. 

AbstractToMindmap is a prompt that analyzes a text file and gives an abstract either as a mindmap or a textfile. It validates the abstracts by quoting significant passages of the text.

Hyper is an example prompt from the author underscore to demonstrate how prompt hacking works. It has been already patched by OpenAI, so it can't be used anymore. It's upped here solely for demonstration.

I have reduced the prompt by using promptreducer's code: https://www.promptreducer.com/
