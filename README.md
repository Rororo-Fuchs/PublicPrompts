# PublicPrompts
Public GPT Prompts is a small collection of my prompts for GPT4.

ExpertArticleWriter_reduced is a prompt that helps You write texts. It summons several experts on a given topic, splits the topics into bits and suggests a structure for Your text. It then makes suggestions for each Sub-Topic which You can change as You like. At the end it outputs the whole text and lets You download it in a filetype You specify. I found it really helpfull for writing articles, applications for public funds and a plethora of other texts. The initial idea is based on Quicksilvers ExpertGPT-prompt. 

AbstractToMindmap is a prompt that analyzes a text file and gives an abstract either as a mindmap or a textfile. It validates the abstracts by quoting significant passages of the text.

I have reduced the prompt by using promptreducer's code: https://www.promptreducer.com/
